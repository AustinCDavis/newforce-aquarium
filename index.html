                    <p class="description">You may not be able to tell from the image, but that's me casting the net. The 3 time sexiest man alive, FBI special agent, two time nobel prize winner, and avid fish collector. Only thing is only one of these are true and you'll never guess which one... All jokes aside I fell in love with fish at a young age working with my dad on his fishing boat. I began to love the feeling of reeling in a new fish or a new record weight fish. This feeling led me to start harvesting and collecting the fish for my aquarium. I chose to do this so other people too could appreciate the creativity and beauty of nature that I've been blessed to experience. So shown below may not be my prettiest fish or biggest fish, but they were my most memorable and exhilarating catches. Come view the full collection with me and feel free to ask questions!
                        <br><br>- Best catches, Martin.<br><br></p>

Mali is known for its crime, terrorism, and kidnappings. My hobbies take me to the remote regions so with a trusted guide I was able to safely enter and leave the country.</p>

The island's reputation of beauty, culture, peace, and fun are accurate. In addition, they welcome a host of exotic wildlife that only add to its beauty. Also, to my surprise, plenty of wild chickens.</p>
